# Echo Threads

## 1. Introduction
Echo Threads is a state-of-the-art messaging platform prioritizing user privacy through advanced security measures. This project report outlines the objectives, features, technologies, security measures, architecture, and challenges faced during development.

## 2. Tech Stack
- Frontend: React Js, Html & CSS
- Backend: Node Js, Express Js
- Database: Atlas MongoDB
- Libraries: crypto-js, Subtle-Crypto

## 3. Features
- End-to-End Encryption
- User-Friendly Interface
- Collaborative Architecture
- Password Handling with Hashing and Salting
- Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
- Digital Signatures for Non-repudiation
- Secure Backend Infrastructure (Atlas MongoDB)
- HTTPS Protocol for Secure Communication

## 4. Process
The project started with a focus on creating a secure messaging platform. The team faced challenges in balancing security and user-friendliness. The frontend utilized Subtle-Crypto libraries, while the backend was deployed securely using Render Website and HTTPS. The project concluded with a robust application ensuring data security and user satisfaction.

## 5. Learnings
- Implementation of end-to-end encryption protocols.
- Collaboration between frontend and backend for a seamless user experience.
- Secure password handling using cryptographic libraries.
- Integration of advanced cryptographic techniques for secure communication.

## 6. Challenges Faced
Balancing stringent security measures with a user-friendly interface proved challenging. The team had to find the right equilibrium to ensure a secure yet intuitive application.

## 7. Future Enhancements
- Integration of multi-factor authentication for enhanced security.
- Implementation of JWT tokens and websocket for improved communication.
- Continuous exploration of emerging encryption technologies.
- Addition of privacy features like ephemeral messages.

## 8. Improvement
While the project achieved its objectives, continuous improvement can be made in terms of user experience and exploring newer encryption technologies for even stronger security.

The Echo Threads project represents a commitment to secure software programming, and its success lies in the meticulous implementation of cryptographic techniques and a collaborative development approach.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
